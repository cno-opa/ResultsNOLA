# ResultsNOLA Measure Calculations

*Originally forked from cno-opa/ReqtoCheckSTAT-scripts*

Use this repository to calculate resultsNOLA measures 1-1, 16-7, 16-8.

For 16-7, you will need to download two reports.  1-1 and 16-9 should update directly from buyspeed DB.

See resultsNOLA.Rmd for more details.
